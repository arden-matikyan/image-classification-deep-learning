# image-classification-deep-learning

Image Classification on the Cifar-10 dataset using various classifiers. From Stanfords CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Each Jupyter Notebook demonstrates iterative development of respective classifiers or Neural Network tools, training, and testing.

Goals

- Understand** Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
- Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**.
- Implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks.
- Implement **Batch Normalization** and** Layer Normalization** for training deep networks.
- Implement **Dropout** to regularize networks.
- Understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and get practice with training them.
- Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, **PyTorch**.
